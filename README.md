# Hybrid-Classical-Quantum-Optimization-for-Scheduling

 Project Overview
This repository showcases my work on a complex scheduling problem, bridging the gap between traditional classical optimization techniques and modern quantum computing approaches. The project was inspired by my research internship experience at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), where I worked on the Burn-in Oven scheduling problem.

Classical Algorithms
This section contains a suite of classical heuristic algorithms developed to solve the scheduling problem efficiently. The focus is on demonstrating different approaches to finding optimal solutions, including:
- **Greedy Heuristics:** Basic algorithms based on simple rules to quickly find a viable schedule.
- **Sorting-based Methods:** Implementations of well-known scheduling rules like Earliest Due Date (EDD), Shortest Processing Time (SPT), and Weighted Shortest Processing Time (WSPT) to form optimized job batches.
- **Advanced Hybrid Heuristics:** A multi-factor approach that uses a Job Priority Index (JPI) to account for multiple variables like processing time, energy consumption, and due dates to create a more robust schedule.

 Quantum Computing Exploration
This part of the project serves as an exploration of how quantum computing can be applied to complex optimization problems. It contains foundational code snippets from the Qiskit library that are relevant to developing and evaluating quantum algorithms, such as
 Core components used to build algorithms like QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), which is a leading candidate for solving optimization problems on near-term quantum computers.
 

 Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language for all algorithms.
- **Qiskit:** IBM's open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits, algorithms, and applications.
- **Pandas/NumPy:** Libraries used for data handling and numerical operations within the classical algorithms.

 How to Run the Code
